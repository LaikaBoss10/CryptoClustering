# CryptoClustering

#### Crypto Currency data is loaded from a csv into a pandas data frame and analyzed in jupyter notebooks in Crypto_Clustering.ipynb using the scikit-learn unsupervised learning cluster algorithm. The number of clusters is determined using the elbow curve method. Then a scatter plot is made showing the clusters of data identified by the algorithm. Then the data is transformed by applying a pca fit transform, and is analyzed again using the elbow curve method and clustering. The data and techniques are compared and analyzed in the jupyer notebook.
